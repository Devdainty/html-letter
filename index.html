            <h2>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</h2>

            <p>Dear Eileen</p>

            <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
                of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
            </p>
            <h3>starting dates</h3>

            <p>
                We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
                could start at the beginning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                <li>second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Please let us know if this is ok, and if so which date you would prefer.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h3>Subjects of study</h3>

            <p>
                At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded reserach facility - as long as the subjects fall
                somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
                the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. saying that, of the ideas you submitted we are most intrigued
                by are as follows, in order of priority: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on perfromance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>0</sup>F), when the
                 audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)
                </li>
                <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascadian Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the
                research to take, reqquired staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            </p>
            <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, i <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
                my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
